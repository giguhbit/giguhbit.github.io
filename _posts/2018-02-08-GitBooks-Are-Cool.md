I've been building an evernote notebook to prepare for the OSCP for over a year now and want to write everything out in a clean format to share. I like the clean formatting of GitBooks so I decided to create a book called Penetration Testing (at least until I can think of a cooler name). At the time of writing, I am still early in the process of moving everything in there, but I figured I have _some_ content should post it anyways.

And so, I present [Penetration Testing](https://giguhbit.gitbooks.io/penetration-testing/content/).
